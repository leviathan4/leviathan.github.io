							“Alright! I think I’m finally done,” I declared. A triumphant smile graced my face as I placed my hands firmly on my hips. I had spent the entire day tirelessly cleaning, making sure every part of the house was spotless. I wanted the house to be clean and tidy in case we had surprise guests and since nobody was home, it seemed like the perfect time. Afterall, the condition of your house says a lot about your family.
						</p>
	  
			  			<p> 
							I surveyed the area, taking pride in my handiwork. The air was clean and hung with a freshness and crispness that revealed the quality of my cleaning. The floors were spotless. Every corner and crack rid of even the tiniest speck of dirt. Every room was a sight of perfection, each item—newspapers, books,  and other loose items—finding their rightful places.
						</p>

			  			<p>
							From the corner of the room, I grabbed a bucket and mop and began a final check through the house to make sure I didn’t miss anything. I lived in a two story house with three distinct bedrooms. The first room was an expansive master bedroom, reserved for my parents and decorated with beautiful furnishings befitting their exotic tastes in design. The second, just beyond the staircase, was a modest guest room ready to embrace weary visitors. And nestled on the far side of the house, was my room, my special haven, a space that bore witness to my dreams and aspirations.  
						</p>

						<p>
							As I was checking the guest room, a mesmerizing sight caught my eye from the doorway. Through the windows gaze, the moon revealed itself in all its splendor and appeared considerably larger than usual. Drawn in by my curiosity, I ventured forth to take a closer look. The window was set apart in an alcove and had a little sitting area beneath it. I sat in front of the window, cracked it open ever so slightly and looked out.
						</p>

						<p>
							A gentle breeze drifted in through the open window, caressing my face as it passed by. The night sky was a mixture of purple and blue, illuminated by thousands of tiny stars glittering like scattered space dust. The moon was at the center just above a small mountain range, stationed there like a pendant suspended from the sky. It was close, and its enormous presence enshrouded the city as it illuminated every hidden corner and remote hollow, leaving no recess of the city to darkness. It was closer than I had ever seen before. I stared at it for a while, mesmerized by its beauty, studying its cratered appearance before eventually turning towards the city.
