        <p class="char-desc">Ayla, a 19-year-old girl, was born in the city of Bellymena, home to the main branch of the Azores family. She is a short girl with shoulder-length white hair and amber eyes. Ayla is a very strange person that seldom answers questions with a straightforward response. She is very playful when it comes to conversation and likes to make people finish her thoughts for her or uses riddles to communicate. She is always full of energy and life.</p>

        <p>After the Nathair family branded all people from the Azores family as traitors she was forced into hiding by her parents. Being a child prodigy in the use of her spirit, she was known by basically the whole world, so she especially had to lay low. She ended up hiding out in a remote town with an old sage where she continued to hone her abilities until she had true mastery of them. She has a white fox spirit that can power up to the nine-tailed fox. She has nine stages of power each indicated by the number of tails she has. She is naturally attuned to her spirit and has such a connection with her spirit that she can stay in spirit beast form for however long she desires without consuming energy. She has the rare trait of having an affinity to two-spirit elements, fire, and electricity. Her fighting style is a balance of both close-range fighting with short daggers and short to medium range ability casting. She is also very agile and fast.</p>
          
        <p>What she wants more than anything is for the Nathair family to lose power of the country and be replaced by someone that cares about everyone, the good of all people in the country regardless of their power, strength, or wealth. To see this through she eventually joins the Resistance Army against her family's wishes to stay out of the war.</p>
          
        <p>(Ayla is very talented at using her elemental abilities, but sheâ€™s also extremely talented in close range combat with her daggers. A mage that is equally skilled in close range)</p>
