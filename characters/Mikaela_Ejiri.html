          Mikaila Evere was born in the city of Halivaara to Emil and Ailisa Evere. She is a 21-year-old girl with short silky black hair, light brown skin, and bright yellow eyes. She can usually be seen wearing black and red colored clothing. She was born into a very caring family that made sure she was well taken care of and was a very happy cheerful girl until tragedy struck. She is half Azores and half Aria.</p>

        <p>Mikaela’s city was attacked five years ago and in this attack, many citizens lost their lives including her mother who passed away right before her eyes. As a result of seeing such a tragic thing take place, she has developed a semi-cold personality and has difficulty opening up to other people. One of the reasons she has trouble opening up to people is because she’s afraid of losing people in her life that she holds dear. Seeing her friends on the verge of death or defeat triggers flashbacks from when her town was attacked and forces her into a fight or flight response where she loses all self-control and unintentionally transforms into her spirit beast form. She also becomes very emotionally driven after the attack.</p> 
          
        <p>the first 2 years after the attack, she was training with her spirit, learning new techniques and becoming stronger. The next 3 years she spent as a bounty hunter clearing away the bandits that popped up in the area. She is very adept to using her dragon spirit and martial arts hand to hand combat and spear combat thanks to her hard work and extreme dedication during the five years after the attack on her city to be ready for the day that she journeyed to take out the people that are responsible for the attack on her city. Although she is apart of the Azores family, she has no connection with the main branch.
          
        <p>Mikaela knows an assortment of fire and wind techniques but has a fighting style that revolves around the abilities of her spirit weapons. (She’s a weapons specialist, a spirit weapon fighter but usually uses brute strength in her )
