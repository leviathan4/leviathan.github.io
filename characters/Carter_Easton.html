        <p class="char-desc">Carter Easton was born in the town of Silverburgh. He is a 23-year-old young man with caramel-colored skin and black hair shaped into a hightop fade. He loves wearing clothes that have a dark shade of green and also has an amazing sense of fashion. He was born into a family that cared about his well being and always wanted the best for him, these roles ended up switching when they became sick with a very rare virus.</p>

          <p>He has always been a rebellious kind of person ever since he was a young boy. Whenever his parents would ask him to do something he would always do the opposite because he enjoyed the attention. However, when the living conditions in his village became worse and his parents fell into sickness he began directing that rebellious attitude towards the Nathair family.  Seeing how much money could be made off of finding and selling spirit weapons, he began a business to find and sell spirit weapons. Eventually, he became interested in the whole archaeological aspect of it and wanted to learn more about the ancient history of the weapons and the civilization that created them.</p> 
          
          <p>He believes that the weapons have far more potential than anyone has seen, because based on his earlier evaluations of the first civilization, in everything that they do he noticed that it was fuelled more by curiosity and thirst for knowledge than finding ways to shortchange people to make a profit. Which means at that time, the first civilization was experiencing a golden age.</p>
          
          <p>He later meets Mikaela and Ayla and is the third strongest out of the group. Although he is good at weapon combat, he thrives when using his wind abilities. He can bring out his spirit in physical form and also has the ability to use spirit beast form, but because he normally takes the support role decides it’s unnecessary and just brings out his spirit as an extra body to do damage. He also has an abnormally large spiritual energy reserve. Carter is very talented in being able to manipulate his spirit energy to use the maximum power of the spirit weapons. (He’s basically the wind mage of the squad)
