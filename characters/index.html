				   			<p>Mikaila Evere was born in the city of Halivaara to Emil and Ailisa Evere. She is a 21-year-old girl with short silky black hair, light brown skin, and bright yellow eyes. She can usually be seen wearing black and red colored clothing. She was born into a very caring family that made sure she was well taken care of and was a very happy cheerful girl until tragedy struck. She is half Azores and half Aria.</p>
						   
						   	<p>Mikaela’s city was attacked five years ago and in this attack, many citizens lost their lives including her mother who passed away right before her eyes. As a result of seeing such a tragic thing take place, she has developed a semi-cold personality and has difficulty opening up to other people. One of the reasons she has trouble opening up to people is because she’s afraid of losing people in her life that she holds dear. Seeing her friends on the verge of death or defeat triggers flashbacks from when her town was attacked and forces her into a fight or flight response where she loses all self-control and unintentionally transforms into her spirit beast form. She also becomes very emotionally driven after the attack.</p>

							<p>the first 2 years after the attack, she was training with her spirit, learning new techniques and becoming stronger. The next 3 years she spent as a bounty hunter clearing away the bandits that popped up in the area. She is very adept to using her dragon spirit and martial arts hand to hand combat and spear combat thanks to her hard work and extreme dedication during the five years after the attack on her city to be ready for the day that she journeyed to take out the people that are responsible for the attack on her city. Although she is apart of the Azores family, she has no connection with the main branch.
							</p>
					
							
							<p>Mikaela knows an assortment of fire and wind techniques but has a fighting style that revolves around the abilities of her spirit weapons. (She’s a weapons specialist, a spirit weapon fighter but usually uses brute strength in her )</p>

							<p>Carter Easton was born in the town of Silverburgh. He is a 23-year-old young man with caramel-colored skin and black hair shaped into a hightop fade. He loves wearing clothes that have a dark shade of green and also has an amazing sense of fashion. He was born into a family that cared about his well being and always wanted the best for him, these roles ended up switching when they became sick with a very rare virus.</p>

							<p>He has always been a rebellious kind of person ever since he was a young boy. Whenever his parents would ask him to do something he would always do the opposite because he enjoyed the attention. However, when the living conditions in his village became worse and his parents fell into sickness he began directing that rebellious attitude towards the Nathair family.  Seeing how much money could be made off of finding and selling spirit weapons, he began a business to find and sell spirit weapons. Eventually, he became interested in the whole archaeological aspect of it and wanted to learn more about the ancient history of the weapons and the civilization that created them.</p> 
							
							<p>He believes that the weapons have far more potential than anyone has seen, because based on his earlier evaluations of the first civilization, in everything that they do he noticed that it was fuelled more by curiosity and thirst for knowledge than finding ways to shortchange people to make a profit. Which means at that time, the first civilization was experiencing a golden age.</p>
							
							<p>He later meets Mikaela and Ayla and is the third strongest out of the group. Although he is good at weapon combat, he thrives when using his wind abilities. He can bring out his spirit in physical form and also has the ability to use spirit beast form, but because he normally takes the support role decides it’s unnecessary and just brings out his spirit as an extra body to do damage. He also has an abnormally large spiritual energy reserve. Carter is very talented in being able to manipulate his spirit energy to use the maximum power of the spirit weapons. (He’s basically the wind mage of the squad)</p>

				   			 <p>Ayla, a 19-year-old girl, was born in the city of Bellymena, home to the main branch of the Azores family. She is a short girl with shoulder-length white hair and amber eyes. Ayla is a very strange person that seldom answers questions with a straightforward response. She is very playful when it comes to conversation and likes to make people finish her thoughts for her or uses riddles to communicate. She is always full of energy and life.</p>

				   			<p>After the Nathair family branded all people from the Azores family as traitors she was forced into hiding by her parents. Being a child prodigy in the use of her spirit, she was known by basically the whole world, so she especially had to lay low. She ended up hiding out in a remote town with an old sage where she continued to hone her abilities until she had true mastery of them. She has a white fox spirit that can power up to the nine-tailed fox. She has nine stages of power each indicated by the number of tails she has. She is naturally attuned to her spirit and has such a connection with her spirit that she can stay in spirit beast form for however long she desires without consuming energy. She has the rare trait of having an affinity to two-spirit elements, fire, and electricity. Her fighting style is a balance of both close-range fighting with short daggers and short to medium range ability casting. She is also very agile and fast.</p>
					 
				   			<p>What she wants more than anything is for the Nathair family to lose power of the country and be replaced by someone that cares about everyone, the good of all people in the country regardless of their power, strength, or wealth. To see this through she eventually joins the Resistance Army against her family's wishes to stay out of the war.</p>
					 
				   			<p>(Ayla is very talented at using her elemental abilities, but she’s also extremely talented in close range combat with her daggers. A mage that is equally skilled in close range)</p>

He is a very articulate and intelligent man with a very calm personality. No matter the situation, he always manages to keep a cool head.</p>

							<p>From a young age, he was always deeply interested in archaeology, but he always kept it as a hobby. However, what he went to University for was geology. After he graduated from University he became employed by the Azores military and tasked with the mission to find a location near Bellymena that was rich in material resources. Before finding the optimal location he visited Silverburgh, where he met his love Ailisa. She left with him on his journey to find a place with useful resources. Eventually, they found the perfect place and founded the city of Halivaara.</p>
