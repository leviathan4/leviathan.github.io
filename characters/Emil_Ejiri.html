        <p class="char-desc">Emil Evere is the father of Mikaela and the husband of Ailisa Evere. He was born in the city of Bellymena, the capital and the stronghold of the Azores family. He is a very articulate and intelligent man with a very calm personality. No matter the situation, he always manages to keep a cool head.</p>

        <p>From a young age, he was always deeply interested in archaeology, but he always kept it as a hobby. However, what he went to University for was geology. After he graduated from University he became employed by the Azores military and tasked with the mission to find a location near Bellymena that was rich in material resources. Before finding the optimal location he visited Silverburgh, where he met his love Ailisa. She left with him on his journey to find a place with useful resources. Eventually, they found the perfect place and founded the city of Halivaara.</p>
