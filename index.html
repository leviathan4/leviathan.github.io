		<h1>What is this World About?</h1>
		<p>The Federation of Kalance, a large island country in the eastern hemisphere, is where the world of Leviathan takes place. It is filled with beautiful landscapes, charming spirits, and diverse people. The history of this country runs deep with a foundation originating from the Azores and Nathair families, two families that have vastly opposing beliefs but have the common goal to do what they believe to be the most beneficial for the country. Each faction seeks to improve the country in line with its worldview. The Azores believe in the potential of human beings and that people given the right motivations with perseverance and determination can accomplish anything. A country with people like this can be mighty with the right leader. The Nathair are obsessed with strength, wealth, and prestige. Their ideal vision for the country is one where the strong rise and the weak fall. Though, even when something is great, there is likely more that can be done to improve it.

		<h1>Setting</h1>
		<div class="text">
		<p>Leviathan takes place in a country called Kalance, a country with a societal infrastructure and technology akin to modern-day society. Spirits and spirit energy, however, are the life blood of this universe and as such are incorporated into much of the technology. The country of Kalance is fortunate enough to be located in an area that allows it to have lush rainforests, beautiful mountain ranges, and wide plains regions with a few areas of arid deserts. A majority of the population of Kalance live in the cities with a few people scattered amongst villages that border the outskirts of the country or cities. Throughout the story, the main character will travel to various villages and cities around the country either gathering information or finding a hideout to escape being hunted.

		<h1>Spirits</h1>
			<div class="text">
			<p>Spirits are beings that reside within humans, they represent the personality personified. These spirits can resemble animals or mythical creatures and when used properly can increase the battle strength of their user. Even without the human counterpart being in spirit beast form, humans can take on traits of their spirits. For example, a human with a dragon spirit is more resistant to physical attacks because of the dragon's hard scaly skin.</p>
 
			<p>Everyone in the Leviathan universe has a spirit, however, everyone may not have the ability to awaken the spirit within them. The spirit and human existence as one. One cannot exist without the other. If you kill the human, you are simultaneously killing the spirit and if you kill the spirit, you are also killing the human. Each spirit also has an element tied to it that the human can make use of. A spirit can have one of the five elements, fire, wind, water, electricity, and earth and in rare cases spirits may contain two elements. Generally, it’s easier to use elemental abilities than it is to unleash the spirit, so even those who lack the ability to do so can still be useful in society and combat by being experts in the usage of elemental abilities.</p>
